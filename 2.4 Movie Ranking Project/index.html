    <h1>The best movies according to Pinklon</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>I still believe</h3>
    <p>
      This movie is very relatable. Losing a very special person as a Christian.
    </p>
    <h3>Facing the Giants</h3>
    <p>
      I love the action and the building of the story. Plus it is a sports movie
      with encouraging theme about trusting God.
    </p>
    <h3>Fireproof</h3>
    <p>
      The movie is about family, marriage and forgiveness. A movie that will
      teach you a lot of practical lesson about family.
